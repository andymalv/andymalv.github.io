Hi! I'm Andy. As I don't enjoy using social media and am often told I need to have some presence on the internet, I've created this website.

I'm a trained biomechanist and data scientist currently in search of employment. I recived my bachelors and masters in Biomedical Engineering from the [University of Miami](https://bme.coe.miami.edu/) where I worked in the [Musculoskeletal Biomechanics Lab](https://mskbiomechlab.coe.miami.edu/). I then went on to receive my Ph.D. in Rehabilitation Sciences from [Boston Unversity](https://www.bu.edu/sargent/), working in the [Neuromotor Recovery Lab](https://sites.bu.edu/nrl/).

My rearch interests are in the biomechanics of human movement and performance, especially in high performance (e.g. sports) applications. I'm also interested in using statistical and machine learning techniques to study a variety of different data.

Outside of work I enjoy waking up early, pour-over coffee, lifting, reading and learning new things. 

If you'd like to contact me (I would really like a job!), please feel free to [e-mail me](mailto:website@andymalv.mozmail.com).
